Console Tic-Tac-Toe
=================

This is a simple console game of tic-tac-toe that I made using C#. I wanted to make a simple project using all
three pillars of Object Oriented Programming just to make sure that I remembered and understand the concepts.
Included is a class diagram made using ncp, that I created prior to writing any code. Of course it changed a little
during implementation, but the overall structure remained the same.

I have not yet implemented the "BombBoard" class that is in the class diagram. I realize that changes may need to be
made to the "Game" class before "BombBoard" will work properly. I guess that means that I either need to redesign
this program to accommodate BombBoard better, or that I need to revisit the way the "Game" class was implemented.

Future Features/Changes:
- Bomb Board (Game Mode)
  + In this version of the game a bomb will be hidden on the board. If either player marks the position with the
    bomb, they automatically lose.

To do list:
- Implement Bomb Board class
